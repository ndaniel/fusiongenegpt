# Generative AI for biomedical insights

FusionGeneGPT is a generative AI tool built with Streamlit and hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, 
designed to extract and summarize biomedical knowledge about human fusion genes from PubMed 
abstracts. It uses the OpenAI GPT API for natural language understanding and 
synthesis. The interface allows users to input gene names (e.g., FGFR3-TACC3) and receive 
concise, context-aware insights about their roles in cancer biology.

Key technologies used:
- Streamlit – for the interactive web interface
- OpenAI GPT API – for generative AI responses
- Hugging Face Spaces – for deployment and public access
- Python – core development language
- PubMed abstract querying/parsing – for biomedical data retrieval (optional depending on implementation)
